    "b. Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to explore this dataset because it looks interesting when we first encounter it. Not only did the dataset include comprehensive body measurement with values one can rarely get, but we also immediately came up with different questions that we would like to understand through this dataset. The amount of variables in this dataset allow us to build a more complex model when it comes to finding the relationship between height, sex, age, and other body measurements. Also, we want to understand the difference between men and women body numerically through this opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Briefly describe why you would be interested in answering these research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the linear regression model, the reason I'm interested in the research question is because I would like to know what are some key factors that affect one's height. If we are able to answer such question, we might be able to find the best way to increase one's height and help children with height below average to grow taller and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the descriptive analytics research question, we aim to investigate if there is a correlation between waist girth and weight, as it is commonly believed that weight has a significant impact on waist girth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inference research question, we postulate that there may not be a significant difference in the mean waist girths between males and females. Therefore, we have formulated hypotheses and conducted research to investigate this hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the logistic regression, I wanted to test if the variables  chest_diameter, height, and weight can predict the sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Display at least 6 observations from your dataframe in this section and\n",
    "show how many rows and columns it has."

Some of the other limitations is the lack of data for people of younger age.

And based on the analyses conducted, we could examine the relationship between weight and height, including all other parameters, which could be pursued in the future."
